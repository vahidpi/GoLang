To implement the ASCII art hosting web service in Go with MySQL and generate a Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:
Set up a MySQL database and a table to store images and their chunks.
Create a Go web server that exposes the REST API endpoints described in the challenge.
Use the github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql package to connect to the MySQL database from the Go server.
Implement the logic for image registration, chunk upload, and image download in the respective API endpoints. Store the data in the MySQL database as required.
Create a Dockerfile to package the application.
Build and run the Docker container.

Assuming you have a directory containing the Dockerfile and the Go code for the web service, you can build the Docker image with the following command:

python
Copy code
docker build -t ascii-service .
This will create a Docker image named ascii-service based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

You can then run the containerized web service using the following command:

python
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 ascii-service
This will start a container running the ascii-service image and forward traffic from the host machine's port 8080 to the container's port 8080.
